# Solbubbles gamepool escrow

## Overview

This program allows users to deposit SPL tokens into the escrow and then withrdraw them.

*Note: Only the authority of the program can send the tokens back to the users because not all actions of the actual Solbubbles game are done on chain. And that is of course because of speed during the actual gameplay as there is no way to make all the actions on chain currently
